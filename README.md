# Meal-finder
This is a Meal Finder app that is made using HTML, CSS, and javascript.
It is an app in which, we can search any meal and after that, 
it will show some results related to that meal. After that,
we can click on any meal and get it's name, recepie, country of origin and
ingredients required. All meals are directly fetched from a third party API.
This app is hosted on github.
